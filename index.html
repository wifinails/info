      <div><h2>BOOKING INFO</h2>················⋆⋅☆⋅⋆················<h3>GENERAL</h3>Bookings are done through the booking portal by clicking on "book an appointment". Select the services and date you'd like to book and enter your contact information to request an appointment. Once I receive your request, I will send you a form. Please complete the form, and provide details/references if you are interested in adding nail art. Anything that is not a solid color is considered a design. You can specify specific goals you have in mind (e.g. healing bitten nails, lengthening nail beds, etc.). Please allow a few days for a reply. Further details will be provided once your appointment is confirmed.<br><h3>SERVICES</h3>All services begin with a Russian dry manicure to clean and prep the nails. Manicures can include a structured base to reinforce strength and a natural curve, if desired. Extensions are sculpted with forms custom fitted to each nail and are priced based on length. I specialize in hand painted and 3d nail art. Custom designs are welcomed.<br><h3>LOCATION</h3>My studio is located in Midtown in a 3rd floor walk up. Specific location will be provided after the appointment is confirmed.<br><h3>PRICING</h3>Services start at $100 and designs are priced based on time and detail. A quote can be provided upon request. If you're working with a specific budget, please mention that in the form.<br><h3>PAYMENT</h3>A deposit is required to secure your appointment and will range based on the estimated cost of service. Deposits are nonrefundable and will goes toward the final cost. Cash is preferred for the remaining balance.<br><h3>CANCELLATIONS</h3>If you need to reschedule or cancel, you can make changes up to 48 hours before the scheduled appointment.<br></div>
